# Minecraft-Reinforcement-Learning
Deep Q Learning for resolving a Partially Observable MDP based on Minecraft environment.
We use gym-minecraft which allows the use of the MalmoProject with an OpenAI like API.

Work realised in collaboration with :

- [Clément Romac](https://github.com/ClementRomac)
- [Pierre Leroy](https://github.com/PierreLeroyBdx)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6
- Jupyter
- Tensorflow

## Installation
- You need to install [Malmö](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo)
- You can then install [gym-minecraft](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft)
- You can find in the folder "envs" :
    - The slightly modified version of gym-minecraft main code we used named `minecraft.py`. Put it in 
    ```your_pip_folder/site-packages/gym_minecraft-0.0.2-py3.6.egg/gym-minecraft/envs/```
- The missions we used. Put them in 
    ```your_pip_folder/site-packages/gym_minecraft-0.0.2-py3.6.egg/gym-minecraft/assets/```

*Warning: The CliffWalking environment doesn’t work (the move action doesn’t work)*

## Models
You can choose between 3 models :
- DQN : Convolutional Neural Network with the current frame

- DQN : Convolutional Neural Network with the last 4 frames
![StackedCNN architecure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentberaud/Minecraft-Reinforcement-Learning/master/StackedCNN_Architecture.png)
- DRQN : Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM layer

## DQN settings
- Implementation of Double Q Learning
- ε-greedy exploration
- Experience replay iplementation

## Note
Unlike Deepmind’s implementations of DQN for Atari games, Minecraft has the constraint that the game isn’t in pause during two actions ordered by the agent. Accordingly the agent and the network have to be as fast as needed to play in the range of time fixed in the environment.

## Credits
We would like to thank Arthur Juliani for all his work and medium articles. Tambet Matiisen for his nice implementation of Gym-Minecraft.
